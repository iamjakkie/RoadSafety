    "\n",
    "**Goal: Reduce the number of accidents in 2017 based on data from 2016**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Question 1. Data Understanding\n",
    "    * Report how many rows and columns of data have been loaded for each one of the files\n",
    "    * Report a general description of the different features that can be found in Accidents.csv\n",
    "    * Select and justify what features will be kept and which ones will not be used from Accidents.csv\n",
    "2. Question 2. Exploratory Analysis\n",
    "    * Plot histograms and other exploratory graphs for insights\n",
    "    * Using roadsafetykey file, explain any patter found and any hypotheses you would have\n",
    "    * Get simple statistics that could help understand the distribution of the data\n",
    "    * Get a rough sense of identifying areas or type of roads with more number of accidents (Map plot)\n",
    "3. Question 3. Decide Approach\n",
    "    * Explain what different models could be used to reach goal of reducing the number of traffic accidents\n",
    "    * Identify pros, cons and how the effectiveness of this approach could be measured\n",
    "4. Question 4. Data Transformation\n",
    "    * Select and justify features used for the approach and the size of data sample\n",
    "    * Perform transformation required and explain them\n",
    "5. Question 5. Modelling and results\n",
    "    * Build supervised, unsupervised or semi-supervised model and explain the results"
